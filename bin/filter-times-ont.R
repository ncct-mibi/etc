# filter ONT fatsq reads based on elapsed time since beginning (since the min timestamp)
# timestamps in nanopore fastq are:
# start_time=2020-09-23T14:20:24Z

# input: pass (1) minutes [integer] and 1 or more fastq file (path) and as args
# output: write reads that are between min (start time) and minutes to a new file

# algorithm:
# - use sed to get min and max from a fastq, same as in get-times.sh
# - get a vector with timestamps from all reads
# filter vector based on minutes
# use seqkit grep to filter reads
